    "2. <b>Perform a silhouette analysis.</b> One way to assess the quality of the data partitionning is the use of the silhouette analysis. Each silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The silhouette coefficient is computed as follows:<br>\n",

    "     &emsp; 2. For all other clusters $C$, to which $i$ does not belong, calculate the average dissimilarity $d(i,C)$ of $i$ to all observations of $C$. The smallest of these $d(i,C)$ is defined as $b_i=min_C d(i,C)$. The value of $b_i$ can be seen as the dissimilarity between $i$ and its \"neighbor\" cluster, i.e., the nearest one to which it does not belong.<br>\n",
    "     &emsp; 3. Finally the silhouette width of the observation $i$ is defined by the formula: $S_i = (b_i−a_i)/max(a_i,b_i)$.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The coefficient varies between -1 and 1. A value close to 1 implies that the instance is close to its cluster is a part of the right cluster. Whereas, a value close to -1 means that the value is assigned to the wrong cluster.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. <b>Compute the confusion matrices.</b> In the context where some labeled data are available for assigning clusters to known labels, we need to find which cluster corresponds to which label.
